# RNA-seq-Trimming-Tool

## About
Most modern sequencing technologies produce read that have a deteriorating quality towards the ends, incorrectly called bases in some regions and ... . All these bad quality reads negatively impact on assembly, mapping and downstream bioinfomatics analyses. These are particulary true, in de novo assembly where the genome or the transcriptome is reconstructed only based on information contained in reads.

This is an independant module for adapter and quality trimming of RNA-seq data which uses Trimmomatic. This module is integrated in a pipeline of de novo assembly for non-models organisms. Here is the pipeline link : https://github.com/arnaudmeng/denovo-assembly-pipeline-upmc

## Version
0.0.1

## Requirements

Python 2.7.6 & Java (Trimmomatic)
